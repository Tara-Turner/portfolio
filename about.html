        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>My name is Tara Turner and I currently attend CodeRVA. When I am not there, I am at my job as a togo server at Rosa's Pizza. I consider myself an amateur photographer, and enjoy capturing memories in the world around me. I also enjoy reading mystery books and watching horror movies.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I currently attend CodeRVA Regional High School as a Senior. I am on the Associates Degree Pathway and taking dual enrollment classes through J. Sergent Reynolds. I have made the Dean's List and the Presidents List at Reynolds. This pathway has allowed me to learn different coding languages such as Python, Java, and HTML/CSS. Along with the Associates Degree, I will also be graduating with an advanced diploma, as I have taken two years of German and two years of Spanish.</p>
        <p>I am involved in a plethora of clubs at CodeRVA including Student Mentoring, Yearbook, National Honors Society, Student Council Association, Prom Commitee, and Student Ambassadors. I was formerly in Robotics and assisted the Leo Club regularly, but had to drop them as my schedule did not allow time for them. I was formerly Junior Class Representative, and I am currently Senior class representative. I was also the head editor of the yearbook club, and I had a leadership role in NHS.</p>

        <h2>Internship Experience</h2>
        <p>The Internship through "Maxx Power" has given me an opportunity to explore a number of skills in the CS industry. I was tasked with not only building this portfolio, but handling data, building a website, and creating policies as well as terms and conditions.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Data Management</h4>
        <p>My first week of the internship, I was assigned to the Business Intellegence and Data Governance team. My team worked together to organize and analyze data from 2010-2019 into their own categories based on the reason for the power outage. We also put this data into several graphs to show the amount of outages per month and the percentage of each outage reason.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Website Development</h4>
        <p>My second week of the internship, I was assigned to the Web Development team. My team decided it would be much easier to build our own website from scratch rather than fix the site provided to us. We worked with the data and security teams to gather some information about the privacy policy, terms and conditions, and the outage charts to display on our website. We ran into a few issues with the formatting of the website, but we came together to figure out a way to overcome our challenges.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Cyber Security</h4>
        <p>For my final week of the internship, I was placed in the Security group. Here I wrote a few differnt policies and generated the terms and conditions for the Website Development team to encorporate in their website. At first, it was sdifficult to figure out how to write a policy, but after coming up with a basic outline, my team and I did a lot of research and was able to easily come up with some policies for "MAXX Power".</p>

        <h2>Plans After High School?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>After I finish my high school years I want to go to college to study criminology, computer science, neuropsychology, or law. I am extremely indecisive with my major and what I wish to do with my life. I chose CodeRVA as a starting ground for these professions because the world is becoming more technologically advanced, and knowing the basics of computers is super helpful. I also chose this field to have something to fall back on if none of my other interests work out. The internship has opened my mind to the possibility of becoming a web developer as my career path as I have enjoyed doing it.</p>
